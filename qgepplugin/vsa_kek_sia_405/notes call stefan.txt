Call with Stefan

- docs : contain some info about interlis


he could make it work with some additional flags (see from his scripts)
--noSmartMapping
(set the --log flag too)


- notes :
    - first empty model
    - then data
    (as errors in the data could influence the scehma)



- organisations :
    - interlis has no IDs, we need UI to set ID for organisations



- infogrips -> check service at the very end [nice to have, but not in the scope]


- datmodel : can't be distributed with the plugin (licensed !), user needs to add them manually

- datamodel : there can be multiple version, we want to support two versions (2015, 2020), but we only care about the latest patch release


SA 405
